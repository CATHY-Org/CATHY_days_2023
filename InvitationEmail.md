Dear [name],
We are thrilled to announce that in 2023 we will renew the tradition and organize the CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) days!
We would like to invite you to join our community of CATHY users and developers during an on-site event that will be held at the CENTER FOR STUDIES ON ALPINE ENVIRONMENT in San Vito di Cadore (IT) on May 31st and June 1st, 2023.
This informal meeting will bring together researchers interested in or working on topics connected to integrated surface-subsurface hydrological modeling. The meeting will be focused on a number of talks (10-20 min, depending on the total number of contributions) that will address current progress and challenges in coupled surface–subsurface hydrological modeling, solute transport modeling, data assimilation, and catchment hydrology at large. Plus, we’ll make sure plenty of time is left for open discussion.
If you are interested, please fill out the online form (https://forms.gle/c7PjrFvtcjfQtLbs7) or contact any of the organizers by December 23rd, including a tentative title if you would like to contribute with a presentation. 
Respondents will receive a second announcement that will be sent out early next year with the final programme of speakers as well as information on accommodation. 
There is no registration fee for the workshop; however, the number of in-person participants is limited to 40, due to the maximum capacity of the venue. Therefore, respondents will be assigned a spot on a first-come-first-serve basis. Additional respondents will be provided with a zoom link for online participation.
Further details and updates will be posted on the workshop webpage [link to come]. For more information, feel free to contact any of us.
Everyone’s welcome, thanks for forwarding this announcement to anyone who might be interested.
Best,
Benjamin Mary, Matteo Camporese (matteo.camporese@unipd.it), Claudio Paniconi (Claudio.Paniconi@inrs.ca), and Mario Putti (mario.putti@unipd.it)
